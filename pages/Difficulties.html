    <h1>Why it is so difficult to prevent IPV?</h1>

      <h2>Intimate relationships</h2>
        <h3>
          IPV generally takes place in romantic and intimate relationships where partners have physical 
          access to each other's mobile devices. This makes protecting one's privacy very difficult and 
          exhausting. For instance, Mike and Anna just graduated from college and are in an intimate relationship. 
          hile Anna goes to yoga class and leaves her phone with Mike, he installed spy apps on her phone because he
          doesn't trust her. He now has access to Anna's private information such as live location, text messages, 
          photo gallery, etc. IPV not only happens within intimate relationships but also professional relationships 
          as colleagues and teammates.
        </h3>
        <h2>Inequality in resources</h2>
          <h3>
            It may in even harder to fully defend against potential abusers who has a high social profile. Victims with 
            lower social or economic profiles may find security services difficult to access.
          </h3>
        <h2>Professionals' lack of technology experience</h2>
          <h3>
            Some professionals including caseworkers, lawyers, or police does not have the technology expertise to best help 
            the victim with their digital threats. And sometimes, hiring experts to investigate their IPV case may cost thousands 
            of dollars without guaranteed conviction of the abuser.
          </h3>
        <h2>Spyware's ability to be hidden and easily installed</h2>
          <h3>
            You can find a variety of spyware on the internet just by searching. And after installing the app, it can be very hard 
            to get rid of them mainly due to their ability to hide from the human eye. Most of the spyware doesn't have an icon, which 
            is very hard for the victim to identify. In addition, these applications usually can't be detected by anti-virus and anti-spyware 
            softwares, therefore doesn't get any attention from the user.
